# This project is about creating a command-line shell, that mimics the behavior of bash.

## We implement the following builtins:
◦ **echo with option -n**

◦ **cd**

◦ **pwd**

◦ **export**

◦ **unset**

◦ **env**

◦ **exit**

## The following signal behaves like in bash:

◦ **ctrl-C**

◦ **ctrl-D**

◦ **ctrl-\\**
